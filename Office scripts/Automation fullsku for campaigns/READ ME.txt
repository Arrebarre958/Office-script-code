This script is in order to basically flesh out a campaign export and add the size SKU suffix to what's in there. 

In "sheet1" you need to have a full centra product export (with size). In "sheet2" you need to have whatever 
campaign export you want to work on. Important that the sheets are named "sheet1" and "sheet2" without any space between
letters and numbers.
